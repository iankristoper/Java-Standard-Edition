I recently signed up with Fasthosts for a small, and cost-effective dedicated server for my web development business. What stood out to me was their competitive pricing and the ability to speak to a real human being...
Fasthosts in my opinion are the best hosting/domain company I have ever used. As someone that's been in the tech business for over 37 years and used Fasthosts for over 10 years, I recommend them 100%.
...the experience has been nothing short of outstanding. Fasthosts has proven to be a reliable and efficient platform for my websites, allowing me to focus on what I do best: digital marketing and SEO.
